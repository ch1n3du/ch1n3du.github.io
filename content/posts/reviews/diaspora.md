*"."*

Diaspora tells the story of post-humans and their quest for meaning.
The first chapter *Orphanogenesis* 

It was good read, although sometimes challenging Greg Egan can
sometimes go for pages explaining the fundamentals of fictional physics
of the world. Most of the times these are fun to read but can get annoying
uninteresting at times.
